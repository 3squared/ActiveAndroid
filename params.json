What does that mean exactly? Well, ActiveAndroid allows you to save and retrieve SQLite database records without ever writing a single SQL statement. Each database record is wrapped neatly into a class with methods like save and delete.\r\n\r\nInstead of\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nINSERT INTO Items(id, name) VALUES(NULL, 'My Item');\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe write\r\n\r\n```java\r\nItem item = new Item();\r\nitem.name = \"My Item\";\r\nitem.save();\r\n```\r\n\r\nand querying the database should feel familiar\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM Items;\r\n```\r\n\r\nis now\r\n\r\n```java\r\nnew Select().from(Item.class).execute();\r\n```\r\n\r\nActiveAndroid does so much more than this though. Accessing the database is a hassle, to say the least, in Android development. ActiveAndroid takes care of all the setup and messy stuff, and all with just two simple steps of configuration.\r\n\r\nActiveAndroid is easy!","name":"Activeandroid","tagline":""}
